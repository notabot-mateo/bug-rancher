# Project State

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 4 (Upgrades) — Ready to start
- **Status:** Phase 3 complete, discuss Phase 4 next
- **Last Updated:** 2026-01-31 15:42 EST

## Recent Progress

### 2026-01-31 (Session 2)
- ✅ Phase 1: Built compendium grid + collection card UI
- ✅ Phase 2: Built hybrid breeding system (110 hybrids)
- ✅ Phase 2.5: Created creative names for all 110 hybrids
- ✅ Phase 3: Built shop/sell system with pricing tiers

### 2026-01-31 (Session 1)
- Initialized project with GSD structure
- Completed Phase 0 (Foundation):
  - Created 11 bug species with stats (including isopod)
  - Built genetics system (IV/EV)
  - Built breeding manager with slots
- Defined v1 requirements (17 total)
- Created 5-phase roadmap

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Context | Outcome |
|----------|---------|---------|
| 8 stats (VIT/STR/CAR/SPC/SPD/STA/INS/ADP) | More breeding variance | Implemented |
| 100 base stat points per species | Balancing baseline | Working well |
| IV range 0-31, 25% floor inheritance | Pokemon-inspired | Implemented |
| 11 base species + 110 hybrids | 121 total species | All named |
| Hybrid breeding = Option 3 | Simplifies to base species | Prevents explosion |
| Hybrid stats 60/40 | Dominant parent weighted | Implemented |
| Pricing: ⭐=10g to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐=250g | Economy balance | Implemented |
| Hybrids +50% sell price | Reward for breeding | Implemented |

## Open Questions for Phase 4

- What upgrades to offer?
  - Faster incubation
  - More breeding slots (2? 3?)
  - IV scanner?
  - Auto-hatch?
- Pricing for upgrades?
- Unlock order?

## Team Notes

- **Sean** — Design lead, active direction
- **Ike** — GSD workflow guidance
- **Mateo** — Code + design support

## Context Recovery

If you're reading this after a context reset:
1. This is Bug Rancher, an idle breeding game
2. We're on Phase 4 (Upgrades)
3. Phases 0-3 are DONE
4. Check `memory/game-design-channel.md` for channel state
5. Ask Sean what's next
