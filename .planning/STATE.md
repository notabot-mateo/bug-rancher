# Project State

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 1 (Bug Collection)
- **Status:** Ready to plan
- **Last Updated:** 2026-01-31

## Recent Progress

### 2026-01-31
- Initialized project with GSD structure
- Completed Phase 0 (Foundation):
  - Created 10 bug species with stats
  - Built genetics system (IV/EV)
  - Built breeding manager with slots
- Defined v1 requirements (17 total)
- Created 5-phase roadmap

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Context | Outcome |
|----------|---------|---------|
| 8 stats (VIT/STR/CAR/SPC/SPD/STA/INS/ADP) | More breeding variance | Good - feels distinct |
| 100 base stat points per species | Balancing baseline | Working well |
| IV range 0-31, 25% floor inheritance | Pokemon-inspired | Implemented |
| 5% × level EV gain | Combat reward scaling | Ready for Phase 2+ |
| Start with breeding only | Scope control | Deferred runs to v2 |

## Open Questions

- Art style direction (pixel art confirmed, but specifics TBD)
- Sound/music approach
- Target platform (PC? Mobile? Both?)

## Team Notes

- **Sean** — Design lead, wants incremental power creep
- **Richie** — Has his own project (Danny's Inferno), may assist
- **Mateo** — Code + design support, GSD workflow driver

## Session Notes

### 2026-01-31 - Initial Session
- Brainstormed bug roster with Sean
- Iterated on stat names (Venom→Special, Reflex→Speed, Perception→Instinct)
- Built full genetics backend
- Set up GitHub repo: notabot-mateo/bug-rancher
- Initialized GSD structure
