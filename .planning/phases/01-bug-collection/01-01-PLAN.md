# Phase 1: Bug Collection

## Plan 01: Core UI Implementation

### Goal

Create the two-tier collection system: Species Compendium (grid) → Individual Bugs (card hand)

### Requirements Addressed

- CORE-01: Player can own and view bugs
- CORE-02: Bug displays stats, IVs, quality
- UI-01: Main screen shows collection
- UI-02: Bug detail view
- UI-05: Star rating visible

### Prerequisites

- ✅ bugs.json with 11 species (including isopod)
- ✅ BugDatabase for loading species
- ✅ BugInstance class
- ✅ Genetics system for star ratings

### Tasks

#### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Create Godot project structure
- [ ] Set up autoloads (BugDatabase, GameManager)
- [ ] Create main scene shell

#### 2. GameManager (Player Data)
- [ ] Create GameManager singleton
- [ ] Store player's bug collection (Array of BugInstance)
- [ ] Store discovered species (Array of species IDs)
- [ ] Initialize with starter isopod on first run

#### 3. Compendium Screen (Species Grid)
- [ ] Create CompendiumScreen scene
- [ ] GridContainer for species slots
- [ ] SpeciesSlot component:
  - Sprite (or silhouette if undiscovered)
  - Species name (or "???" if undiscovered)
  - Count badge (how many you own)
- [ ] Click slot → open BugCollectionScreen for that species

#### 4. Bug Collection Screen (Card Hand)
- [ ] Create BugCollectionScreen scene
- [ ] Header with species info (name, description, sprite)
- [ ] ScrollContainer with HBoxContainer for cards
- [ ] Back button to compendium

#### 5. Bug Card Component
- [ ] Create BugCard scene (front and back)
- [ ] **Front:** Sprite, name/nickname, stars, top stat
- [ ] **Back:** Full stat bars, IV display
- [ ] Flip animation on tap
- [ ] Visual star rating (1-5 stars)

#### 6. Scene Flow
- [ ] Main.tscn loads CompendiumScreen
- [ ] Signal connections for navigation
- [ ] Transition animations (optional polish)

### Files to Create/Modify

```

├── CompendiumScreen.tscn  # Species grid
├── BugCollectionScreen.tscn # Cards for one species
└── components/
    ├── SpeciesSlot.tscn   # Grid slot
    └── BugCard.tscn       # Flippable card

├── compendium_screen.gd   # Grid logic
├── bug_collection_screen.gd # Card hand logic
├── species_slot.gd        # Slot component
└── bug_card.gd            # Card component

data/
└── bugs.json              # (exists, add isopod)
```

### Verification

- [ ] Game launches to compendium grid
- [ ] 11 species slots visible (1 discovered, 10 locked)
- [ ] Starter isopod appears in collection
- [ ] Clicking isopod slot shows card hand
- [ ] Card shows name, stars, top stat on front
- [ ] Tapping card flips to show all stats
- [ ] Stars accurately reflect IV quality
- [ ] Can navigate back to compendium

### Notes

**Art:** Use placeholder colored rectangles for sprites. Real art later.

**Card flip:** Simple tween animation — scale X to 0, swap content, scale X back to 1.

**Responsive:** Design for mobile aspect ratio (portrait 9:16)
